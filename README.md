# Exploratory Weather Analysis

## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze data from Hawaii Weather Stations to visualize weather patterns from previous years. Data from a SQLite database will be reflected into Python's SQLAlchemy, where the data will be analyzed using Pandas and Matplotlib. Flask will be used in order to create local API endpoints that will return data specified at by the user.
